# GoogleFontPicker

### Features Introduction
1. It would take more time to fetch google font list and default font file for every font family
2. When selected a font family, it will show all variants for it. If the font file has been downloaded, it will be with clear background otherwise light gray.
3. The selected font will be applied to the label with text: "Hi, PicCollage! It is Charles."

### No List Shows?
If you got a alert, it might be no networking or no google api key issues.
